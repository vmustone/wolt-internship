# Delivery Order Price Calculator

## Description

This is a web application built with React and TypeScript that calculates the price of a delivery order based on user input. The application allows users to enter relevant information, such as the number of items and delivery details, and then calculates the total price accordingly.

### Current Status

The application is still a work in progress. While the core functionality of the price calculator is implemented, there are some known issues that have yet to be resolved due to time constraints. The code is not fully optimized, and certain features (such as automated tests and complete error handling) are still pending.

## Features

- Input fields for order details.
- Calculation of total price based on input.
- Basic error handling for invalid inputs.
